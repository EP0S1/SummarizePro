                <p>There are no two ways about it: your journey to impossible is going to be long and arduous. As with any long journey, you'll need fuel to keep you going. That includes food and sleep, but you also need psychological fuel –⁠ in other words, drive.</p>
                <p>Drive, or motivation, nudges us toward action. But what creates drive in the first place? From an evolutionary perspective, it's all about surviving in a world where resources are scarce. Drive is evolution's way of getting us to either fight each other to obtain the resources we need or to use creativity to make more resources.</p>
                <p>But drive doesn't consist of just one thing. There are various drivers, like fear, curiosity, and passion. All of these provide psychological fuel –⁠ and you can harness them to achieve the impossible.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p>All psychological drivers are divided into one of two categories: extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic drivers are things like money, fame, food, and sex. They're external to ourselves, and we chase them to win the evolutionary survival game. Intrinsic drivers, on the other hand, are within us. They're psychological and emotional concepts like curiosity, passion, meaning, and purpose.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Psychological research tells us that extrinsic drivers only motivate us to a certain extent. They get weaker once we have enough money to pay for food, clothing, and shelter. After we've met these basic needs, it's the intrinsic motivators that take over. It's those intrinsic drivers we'll be focusing on in these sections.</p>
                <p>The five most powerful intrinsic motivators are curiosity, passion, purpose, autonomy, and mastery. You can stack them together so they feed off one another –⁠ and so you can achieve the impossible.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title gradient-text">Curiosity: The First Step</h3>
                <p>Let's start with curiosity, the first element in the intrinsic motivator stack. You can start building it by making a list. Write down –⁠ by hand –⁠ 25 things you're curious about. What might you read a book about or attend a lecture on? Be as specific as possible. For instance, don't just write down football or food. Instead, write down: the specific mechanics and maneuvers necessary to play the left tackle position or the potential for grasshoppers to become a primary human food source.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3 class="subsection-title gradient-text">From Curiosity to Passion</h3>
                <p>Now that you have a list of things you're curious about, it's time to start hunting for overlap between the items on it. This will help you identify your passions, your next intrinsic motivator.</p>
                <p>When you explore your curiosities, your brain rewards you with small amounts of a feel-good chemical known as dopamine. Dopamine is the key ingredient in drive – it makes you excited, engaged, and more likely to keep doing whatever it is you're doing.⁠ But satisfying your curiosity only gets you small amounts of dopamine – not enough for you to achieve the impossible over the long-term.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title gradient-text">Finding Your Passion</h3>
                <p>What you need is passion, which provides a much greater dopamine boost. Often, you can find your passions by looking for intersections among your curiosities. Let's say one of your curiosities is the left-tackle football position. Another is the potential for using grasshoppers as a sustainable food source. Putting these two together, your passion might be to find a way to use grasshoppers as a fuel for athletes.</p>
                <p>When you combine items on your curiosities list like this, you're amping up your engagement and identifying passions. As you begin to explore and act on your passions, you receive a reward: more dopamine.</p>

                <p>After you've identified your passions, you can begin to explore them by reading articles, listening to podcasts, or watching videos on the subject. This will help to feed your curiosities and allow you to explore them a little bit each day. That's important, because it gives your brain time to process the information. Next, it's time to transform them into purpose. That's the desire to do things that matter not just to you, but also to other people.</p>

                <p>The "other people" part is more important than you might realize. That's because the brain is innately –⁠ that is, neurochemically –⁠ motivated to care for and connect to other people. When you have a purpose, you satiate that innate desire –⁠ and your brain rewards you for it. The reactivity decreases in various regions of the brain, like the amygdala, and increases in others, like the right insular cortex. The upshot is greater resilience to stress, paired with greater motivation and productivity.</p>
                <p>So, how do you find your purpose? Get out your pen and paper and write another list. This time, jot down 15 big problems that really concern you –⁠ like world hunger, poverty, or climate change. Then, look for areas where your passions intersect with one or more of these problems. Any intersection is a potential purpose –⁠ you can have more than one.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title gradient-text">Setting Clear Goals</h3>
                <p>The answer is: by having clear goals. In the late 1960s, psychologists Gary Latham and Edwin Locke conducted a study that showed just how powerful goals can be. In it, lumberjacks were divided into two groups. One group was told to gather as much wood as possible. The other group was asked to reach specific quotas. Neither group was offered any financial incentives whatsoever. The result? The lumberjacks that had the quotas gathered far more wood than the no-quota group.</p>
                <p>Those results were later confirmed in dozens of studies across industries. Clearly, if intrinsic drivers fuel our path toward the impossible, goals are our roadmap.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3 class="subsection-title gradient-text">High, Hard Goals (HHGs) and Clear Goals</h3>
                <p>According to Latham, big goals lead to the largest increases in motivation and productivity. These are called high, hard goals, or HHGs for short. They're the major steps on your way to achieving your purpose. Your HHG might be, for instance, getting a degree in nutrition or starting a company.</p>
                <p>HHGs can take years to achieve. So you'll need smaller daily targets along the way. Let's call these clear goals; they take you closer to your HHGs. Say you're a writer, and your HHG is to pen a novel. One of your clear goals might be to write 500 words every day between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.</p>

                <p>Completing your clear goals will reward you with dopamine. Even so, endless persistence can be tough. That's where grit comes in –⁠ the energy it takes to push through years of hard work. Some people are more naturally gritty than others. But don't worry if that's not you. It's a skill you can improve.</p>
                <p>One way to cultivate grit is to work around your natural energy levels. Willpower is a major aspect of grit, and it deteriorates throughout the day. So schedule your most difficult daily task for the morning, when your energy is at its peak. Then, continue your tasks in order of descending importance.</p>

Brain scans taken by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck show the benefits of thinking this way. When faced with a hard problem, Dweck found that the brains of people with growth mindsets lit up and became highly active. By contrast, the brains of people who didn't believe their abilities could improve completely shut down –⁠ in other words, those people didn't think they could ever solve the problem, so their brains didn't even try.</p>
